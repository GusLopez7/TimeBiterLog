# TimeBiterLog

This utility (in Beta) looks deceptively simple but it can be extremely helpful with your time management. It allows you to log your activities throughout the day. As your entries progress, you can keep perspective on your achievements, big and small, so you can answer this question: what happened in the last 8 hours?

The data is saved to your browser's local storage, so it's only yours.

The reset button will empty out your list so you can start over the next day.
